"French correspondents of major Enlightenment figures"
Electronic Enlightenment, Comsa, Maria, Conroy, Melanie, Edelstein, Dan, Edmondson, Chloe, Willan, Claude, and Groupe d'Alembert

This dataset merges 1) metadata from the Electronic Enlightenment Project at Oxford University for the French correspondents of important Enlightenment figures (including Voltaire, Rousseau, Hume, and Smith); with 2) metadata from the Groupe d'Alembert (led by Ir√®ne Passeron) concerning d'Alembert's French correspondents. These data were subsequently 3) enriched by a group of researchers at (or formerly at) Stanford: Maria Comsa, Melanie Conroy, Dan Edelstein, Chloe Edmondson, and Claude Willan. We applied a metadata ontology ("Procope") that classifies prosopographical data according to a hierarchical, controlled vocabulary, and added further data about academy and salon memberships. Details about Procope are available as an appendix to "The French Enlightenment Network," Journal of Modern History 88, no. 3 (2016): 495-534. NB: the letter count columns (F-H) are not all up-to-date, due to discrepancies between the original data dump from EEP and subsequent revisions to their database.
